Mini Project 2: HR Attrition Analysis

Industry: Human Resources Objective: Analyze employee attrition and performance trends using SQL and Python.

Project Tasks

· Load employee and job data from CSV using Python.

· Store the data into a relational database.

· Use SQL to compute attrition rates, average tenure, and department-wise trends.

· Visualize attrition distribution, role stability, and demographic insights.

Data Sources

1. HR Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

KPIs and Formulas

KPI Description / Formula

Attrition Rate (Number of Leavers / Total Employees) * 100

Average Tenure AVG(YearsAtCompany)

Role Stability AVG(YearsInCurrentRole) GROUP BY JobRole

Department Attrition Attrition Rate GROUP BY Department

Gender-wise Attrition Attrition Rate GROUP BY Gender

SQL Implementation Plan

· Create employees table with columns like age, department, years_at_company, attrition.

· Query attrition stats and breakdowns by department, gender, and job role.

· Compute averages and counts to derive KPIs.

Python Implementation Plan

· Load and clean data using pandas.

· Perform grouping and aggregation logic in pandas.

· Visualize attrition rates by role, department, gender using seaborn and matplotlib.
